# SeLinux

* * SELinux is designed to enhance existing security solutions.such as keeping software up-to date, using hard-to-guess passwords, firewalls, and so on.

* * SELinux can be used to enforce data confidentiality and integrity, as well as protecting processes from untrusted inputs.

* * SELinux is a Linux security module that is built into the Linux kernel.

* * SELinux decisions, such as allowing or disallowing access, are cached. This cache is known as the Access Vector Cache (AVC).

* * When using SELinux, files, including directories and devices, are referred to as objects.
* * * Processes, such as a user running a command or any application, are referred to as subjects.
* * <b>In Fedora, SELinux provides a combination of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Type Enforcement (TE), and,optionally, Multi-Level Security (MLS)</b>
